type: Type predicates and assertions for Node
=============================================

This Node module is meant to provide a unified place to ask and
assert about all the built-in JavaScript and Node types.

Further documentation coming soon.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

```shell
npm install typ
```

Or grab the source. As of this writing, this module has no
dependencies, so once you have the source, there's nothing more to do
to "build" it.


Testing
-------

```shell
npm test
```

Or

```shell
node ./test/test.js
```


API Details
-----------

Coming soon!


To Do
-----

* Flesh out docs.
* Add tests.


Contributing
------------

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.
Submit them at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/leb/).

Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the
best. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests that update
the test suite. Thanks!
